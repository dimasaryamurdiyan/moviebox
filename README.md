## Android App Architecture - Guideline to Modularization

**Top tip**: A module graph (shown above) can be useful during modularization planning for
visualizing dependencies between modules.

The MovieBox app contains the following types of modules:

* The `app` module - contains app level, presentation layer and scaffolding classes that bind the rest of the codebase,
  such as `MainActivity`, `MyApplication` and dependency injection. The `app` module depends on `data` module and
  required `domain` module.

* `data:` module - contains operation about accessing or manipulating data both network nor local.
  This module depend on `domain` module, but it shouldâ€™t depend on app module.

* `domain:` module - most deep layer that contains all business logic for each specific usecase, such as `IMovieRepository` etc. This module not depend to any module, because this is the deepest layer based on Clean Architecture guidelines.
